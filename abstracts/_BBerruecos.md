title: Limits of Being, Limits of Language. Iconicity, Metrical Anomaly, and Structural Dislocation in Parmenides' Hexameter
---

One of the main topics prominently discussed in Parmenides’ fragments is language. The goddess frequently associates this subject with the constraints imposed by certain forms of linguistic expression. Additionally, one of the essential points of Parmenides’ philosophy, which contrasts with later philosophical systems within Eleatism (particularly that of Melissus), is that one of the “signs” or predicates of Being (reiterated threefold in fragment B8) is that it is not “unfinished” (ἀτελεύτητον B8.32) or that it is “already finished” (τετελεσμένον B8.42). In this paper, I propose to link these two problems, the limits of Being and the limits of language, through a common bridge or platform that unites them, namely, the metrical phenomena of Parmenides’ hexameter. The issue I want to discuss is the extent to which the very notion of the limitation of Being is, in fact, a result of the constraints of linguistic representation. I will approach these problems by describing certain metrical and rhythmic phenomena that significantly occur in the passages in which the goddess speaks about the limitation and finiteness of Being. These phenomena (cancellation and blurring of the central caesura, breaking of Hermann's bridge, and violent enjambement) constitute objective and quantifiable indexes in which the complex interactions between the meaning denoted in the verses and the meaning connoted in the poetic form can be codified and demonstrated. I hypothesize that the metrical anomalies of Parmenides' hexameter, particularly those occurring in the passages that speak about the limits of Being, serve a specific function: on the one hand, to iconically reinforce the ideas of limitation and completeness denoted in the text and, on the other, to evidence the hierarchy existing between the linguistic and ontological categories in Parmenides’ Poem.
