title: Conjectures about the presence of the attributes of cosmological principles in the discourse on the nature of “what is” (DK28B8)
---
Studies on Parmenides and its reception have mostly focused on examining the poem's theses and each of its "parts." In keeping with the theme of this conference, I propose to examine how the vocabulary chosen by Parmenides in fragment DK28B8 to explain the statements of fragment B2 — "what is, is, and cannot not be" (first formulation); "What is not, is not, and cannot be" (a formulation consistent with the first) echoes that of his predecessors and contemporaries to enunciate the nature of his archai within the framework of his cosmological investigations. Terms such as "*ageneton*" and "*anôlethron*," "*mounon*" and "*oulomeles*," "*atremes*" and "*ateleston*," among others, attest to the presence of notions previously attributed to principles by the other "Pre-Socratics."

We intend to evaluate the extent to which the use of terms common to the vocabulary of investigations into the nature of principles in the cosmologies of his time to indicate the nature of what is in Parmenides' poem highlights the extent to which Parmenides' language is a tributary of that of his predecessors and contemporaries, even as he uses it to unveil a new horizon and a new path of investigation.
