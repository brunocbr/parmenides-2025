What do neoplatonists mean when they say that something is a “being”, an *on*? They mean something specific, because they also speak of things that are beyond and also beneath “beings”. They also do not always mean the same thing by “being” as can be seen by their widely differing interpretations of Parmenides’ deductions concerning “being”. Plotinus appeals to Parmenides as a witness in his theory of *Nous*, the self-knowing principle of *psyche* and the perceptible world. Proclus, however, takes Parmenides to speak of a principle much prior to Nous in the causal order, *to hen on*, “the One Being”. This represents a striking departure in many respects. For instance, whereas *Nous* is held by both Plotinus and Proclus to be not only knowable but the primary form of knowledge, Proclus holds "the One Being" to be a cause of all knowledge without being in any way actually known. Thus the one holds that Parmenides reasoned about something supremely knowable and the other holds that he discourses about something wholly unknown, which raises of course the question of how Proclus thought that Parmenides wrote about it in the first place. The distance between Proclus and Plotinus on “being” has often been remarked, but this has not translated into an appreciation that their interpretation of Parmenides is similarly distinct. In my paper I will present what each of them understands by *to on* and how each of them finds their own theory in Parmenides’ poem. I hope thereby to fill in an important gap in our understanding of the Neoplatonic reception of Parmenides and also to assist in the search for a satisfying translation of *to on* in bioth authors
