In my presentation, which will be short, I want to raise a rather simple question: what is the implicit grammatical object, assuming that there is one, of the substantive *dizêsis*, in the recurring phrase *hodos dizêsios* (B2.2, B6.3, B7.2)? Asking the question is gesturing to the answer: not ‘being’, but a totality of which ‘being’ is one component. The next step would be to explore the impact of this answer on the usual conundrums – the relationship between ontology and physics, the number of routes, and the construal of the *distichus diabolicus* at B8.53f. A problematizing program of research, rather than a key.
