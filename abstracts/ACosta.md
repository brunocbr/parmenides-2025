title: Parmenides and the mutual exclusivity between being and coming-to-be
---
Throughout all the Fragments that came to us from the Poem written by Parmenides, the author adopts a textual use of the verbs «to be» and «to come-to-be» that clearly operates a mutual exclusion between them, so that not only what is can not «come-to-be», but also that which comes- to-be can not «be». It is an incompatibility so precisely observed that both verbs are never presented side by side in the Parmenidean text, except for the purpose of clearly asserting their incompatibility, as in B8, 13-14, for example. This study aims to reassess whether the unrestricted incompatibility between being and coming-to-be recognised in Parmenides’ Poem can be seen as (a) an important key in a possible reordering of his Fragments; and (b) the main reason for distinguishing between truth and opinions, respectively.
