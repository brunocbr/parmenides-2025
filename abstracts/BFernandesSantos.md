title: "Some reflections on the significance of *doxai* in Parmenides’ Poem"
---
Over the years, studies dedicated to Parmenides' *Poem* have highlighted various aspects of its language and style, shedding new light on how to approach and understand the content of his poetry. In recent years, significant progress has been made in examining the meaning of *doxai* and why Parmenides chose to include them in his work. This progress has also provided insights into one of the longstanding questions surrounding Parmenidean studies: what is the importance of *doxai*? This presentation aims to explore some of the interpretations proposed by scholars in recent years to address this question, while also presenting my own perspective—namely, that even though Parmenides criticizes the *doxai* of mortals, their content still plays an important role in the *Poem.* In essence, the real challenge, as Shaul Tor recently noted, is not merely to answer why Parmenides chose to write and include the opinions (*doxai*) in his poetry, but rather to consider how it was possible for him, as a human being, to transcend the error inherent in ordinary opinions and reflect upon and write about *alêtheia*. The realm of *alêtheia* lies beyond the ordinary experience of human beings; therefore, how was it possible for Parmenides to enter this domain, where error and the wandering nature characteristic of mortals are excluded? Raising these questions is crucial for advancing a proper understanding of how the opinions reflect the ordinary condition of human life. In a certain sense, the *doxai* contain important insights into the day-to-day experiences of mortals. While the opinions should not be regarded as the cornerstone of philosophical investigation, they cannot be dismissed from the pedagogical journey of the initiate in the *Poem*. Thus, although the *doxai* play a subordinate role compared to *alêtheia*, they still hold a place within Parmenides' thought.
