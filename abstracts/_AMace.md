Parmenides\' use of the concept of φύσις has long been noted as important (Mourelatos 1970 = 2008, 62-63), but still awaits a thorough analysis of its context and implications for our understanding of the poem as a whole. In the present paper I will argue that the reference to Homer is crucial for understanding the consistency of Parmenides\' use of the term and its implications.

First of all, Parmenides uses φύσις in conjunction with the verb φύειν and φύεσθαι on the one hand, and with other terms such as δύναμις and ἔργον ergon on the other. The use of φύσις in conjunction with φύειν brings to the fore the dynamic aspect of φύσις as a result of growth. Recent research has shown the extent to which the representation of plants in archaic poetry is based on the perception that plants result from a process of growth that transforms liquids into solid forms and makes plants capable of diffusing more liquids (Buccheri 2024). Things that have a φύσις are understood as the result of previous growth and as capable of a certain effect, that is, as having a certain power or capacity, δύναμις. People who know the nature of things also know the signs, the σήματα, by which they decipher the qualities and power of things. I will first try to show that the various features of this kind of knowledge can be gathered by analysing the single use of φύσις in the Homeric poems (the term is applied to the plant called molu by the gods, *Od*. X 302-306) and their more frequent use of φυή. I will then try to show that these Homeric references explain the rich network in which Parmenides places the term φύσις in correlation with all the previously mentioned terms.

The first result of this study will be a reassessment of the kind of knowledge described in the Doxa section of the poem. Mourelatos called this knowledge a \"naive metaphysics of things\" (Mourelatos 2008, 299-332). I would like to show that Parmenides gives a new dimension to the processual aspect of this knowledge of \'things\', so that individual natures, in their composition, can perhaps be understood as the result of a wider cosmogonical process. Homer\'s molu is then reinterpreted within the framework of an Ionian philosophical style of explanation of the cosmos as a whole. In particular, Parmenides describes the nature and signs of the moon, in which we decipher the same polarisation between dark and light features as in the Homeric work. The moon is Parmenides new molu.

The second result concerns the interpretation of the kind of knowledge implied in the Aletheia section of the poem. Being shows σήματα, so is it a thing? Does it have a φύσις? It is explicitly said that it has not grown (cf. 8, 10). Does this mean that it cannot have a φύσις and a δύναμις? Or does Parmenides invite us to discover a new way of knowing things? I will try to characterise the differences between two kinds of knowledge based on σήματα.
