title: From the way of truth to the deductive method, between Parmenides and On Ancient Medicine
---
During the 5th century BC, the Ancient Greek term ὁδός, besides designating a concrete referent, began to take on a metaphorical and scientific-philosophical meaning, that of ‘way of research’, method. Two texts record this shift: Parmenides’ Poem (fr. 2 Diels-Kranz) and Hippocrates’ treatise On Ancient Medicine (chapter 2), that seems to have resumed Parmenides’ argumentation. Parmenides’ poem represents the true pivot point that marks the transition from poetic, mythological and cosmogonic thought to the new rational investigation of the physis on which nascent philosophy would be founded. Parmenides in fact, while taking up the poetic form and cosmogonic tradition prevalent in his time (much of which has been lost, except Hesiod’s Theogony), wanted to differentiate his discourse from this tradition, which rather than a model becomes a polemical objective. To mark the new course of his inquiry into nature in its entirety, he uses precisely the image of the ὁδός, which from a real referent in the Proem progressively becomes a path of research, a model of reasoning.

In the Proem, the image of the road recurs six times, according to different semantic declinations: only the road travelled by the young Parmenides is authentically defined as ὁδός, as a conscious path, a master road; for all other men and for the passing of time (the alternation of Day and Night) one can speak of beaten tracks (πατοί), of paths (κέλευθοι), which describe a way of going rather than a true consciously oriented journey.

In the course of the poem the image of ὁδός, of proceeding along the straight path or of going astray, is used nine more times: in DK 28B2, vv. 2, 4 and 6; in DK 28B6, vv. 3 and 9; in DK 28B7, vv. 2 and 3, and also in DK 28B8, vv. 1 and 23. However, if in the Proem the term ὁδός would still seem to denote a concrete referent, similar to other images of the archaic poetic tradition and evoke a real experience, in the other occurrences it becomes ‘ideal path, theoretical itinerary, deductive method’.

After analyzing Parmenides’ Proem, which presents the term ‘ὁδός’ in various declinations – path, trail, track – I will try to reiterate the methodological reading of vv. 3 and 5 of Parmenides’ fr. 2, mostly forgotten in favor of ontological or predicative readings. I will try to compare these verses with chapter 2 of On Ancient Medicine, in which scientific medicine polemically distances itself from philosophical medicine. Parmenides’ verses seem to have been a strong model for Hippocrates argumentation and the Hippocratic text seems to be an important example of the reception of Parmenides’ argumentation.
