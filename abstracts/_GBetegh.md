title: ‘It is all full’. A new look at the relationship between ‘what-is’ and the cosmos, and its ramifications for post-Parmenidean philosophy
---
The relationship between the two parts of the Goddess’ speech has been a question that occupied Parmenides’ interpreters since Antiquity. One crucial aspect of this puzzle concerns the relationship between ‘what-is’ as described by the Goddess in the ‘Way of Truth’ on the one hand, and the object she provides an account of in the ‘Way of Mortal Opinion’ on the other. As to this second, it is fairly uncontroversial that she speaks about the constitution of and processes in the physical cosmos. The question, then, is whether in the first part, she speaks about a different entity, transcendent and intelligible, or whether she speaks about the same entity, the physical cosmos, under a different description. It has been argued that this latter reading, sometimes called the ‘aspectual interpretation’ (Palmer 2009), was prevalent among Parmenides’ early interpreters including Plato and Aristotle.

In my presentation, I will revisit this question focusing on B8.28 and B9.3-4. B8.28 states that ‘what-is’ is all full of being (πᾶν δ’ ἔμπλεόν ἐστιν ἐόντος), whereas in B9.3-4 we read that the cosmos is all full (πᾶν πλέον ἐστὶν) the two physical principles,  of light and night, so that there is nothing left empty of them. I will argue that ‘fullness’ creates a strong link between ‘what-is’ on the one hand and the cosmos on the other, emphasised also by the closeness of the two formulations. Indeed, that fact that ‘fullness’ is a crucial feature of both ‘what-is’ and the physical cosmos, can provide the basis for an important argument for the ‘aspectual interpretation’.

I will then turn to two theories – that of Melissus and that of Democritus – both of which are clearly based on Parmenides’ philosophy, and in particular on Parmenides’ description of ‘what-is’. I will argue that ‘fullness’ is a central term for both Melissus in characterising his one being, and for Democritus in characterising the atoms. However, ‘fullness’, for both Melissus and Democritus, is a feature that has crucial physical ramifications. Melissus bases his argument that there is no motion in ‘what-is’ on its being ‘full’, whereas Democritean ‘beings’, the atoms, are impenetrable to one another because they are ‘full’. In fact, the impossibility of motion in Melissus’ ‘what-is’ and the impenetrability of Democritean atoms rely on fundamentally the same understanding of ‘fullness’. This shows that these thinkers understood B8.28 as directly applicable to the physical world, which in turn suggests that they also subscribed to the ‘aspectual interpretation’. But could these considerations – the parallel between B8.28 and B9.3-4, as well as the reception of Melissus and Democritus – invite us to speculate further about the characteristics of Parmenides’ ‘what-is’ and its relation to the physical cosmos?
