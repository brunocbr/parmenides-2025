title: "Parmenides’ Proemium: A Reading Based on the Notion of Limit and the Possibility
of Its Transcendence"
---

One of the few aspects on which there is an almost unanimous consensus regarding the Proemium of Parmenides is its ambiguity. Due to this characteristic, scholars have proposed multiple interpretative possibilities depending on their perspectives on the rest of the Poem, since the Proemium not only functions as a rhetorical device but also serves to introduce the fundamental content of the work. In other words, it contains a profound meaning that expresses the central points of Parmenidean thought. This necessitates a careful reading of the various signs and metaphors that Parmenides presents throughout the journey of the κοῦρος. This presentation aims to interpret the journey narrated in the Proemium through the notion of limit and the possibility of its transcendence, considering different images and metaphors employed by the Eleatic Philosopher throughout the journey, such as the notions of θυμός, εἰδὼς φώς, and κοῦρος, as well as the presence of divinities like the Heliad Maidens, Themis, Dike, and Moira. Through these notions and divinities drawn from the poetic tradition that nourishes Parmenides, a concept of limit is configured—one that, far

from being static and insurmountable, can be transcended. Precisely, the metaphor of the journey represents how the κοῦρος, with the help of the divinities who intervene along the way, surpasses the boundary that separates mortals from the divine, allowing him to reach the abode of the Goddess and receive the revelation of Aletheia.
