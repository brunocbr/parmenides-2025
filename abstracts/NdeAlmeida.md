title: "On Parmenides’ tautological monism: identity as the fundamental property of being"
---

My presentation intents to expose the general lines of a “new” interpretation of Parmenides’ monism, characterized as a ‘tautological monism’. This is so given the fundamental role of the concept of identity in several places of the remainder fragments of his poem *On nature*. In a general sense, I think Parmenides creation of ontological paradigm in Greek metaphysics comes from his peculiar constitution of the concept of what-is or being (*to eon, to einai*) through an equally unprecedented constitution of the concept of identity (*to auto, tauton, kath’heuato*), so as we need express the core of his revolutionary ontological metaphysics as the conception of the identity of being. In the first place, I will present the role of the concept of identity concerning the understanding of the two ways of inquiry exposed in the fragment DK B 2, read as intrinsically correlated with the identity of thinking and being (understood as a logical and epistemological imperative and postulate) of the fragment DK B 3. In a second moment, I will defend that the signs (*sêmata*) of being exposed in DK B 8 are, in a recent jargon, rigid designators of the intrinsic properties of being itself, rigorously deduced following the necessary identity prescribed in the way of being and truth advanced in DK B 2 and 3. Thus, for instance, to be logically and epistemologically entitled to say that what-is or being is indivisible means the same as to denote and describe what-is or being as “the indivisible”. And the same scheme applies to all other signs drawn in DK B 8. Finally, I intend to show how the lines 29-33 of DK B 8 make explicit that identity is the fundamental feature of being and that all other signs of being are synonymous ways of it thanks to his fundamental identity. If possible, during the time of my presentation, I will indicate how such interpretation demands us a critical view of some recent interpretations, particularly those elaborated by Patricia Curd and John Palmer, according to which Parmenides’ ontology would be compatible with some pluralist tenets.
