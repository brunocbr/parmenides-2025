title: "Parmenides and Eudaimonism: The Adaptation of the Eleatic Language of Ontological Stability in Democritus and the Megarian School"
---
Parmenides has not only been read as the father of the Western metaphysics and as the philosopher of Being. Scholars like Antonio Capizzi (*La porta di Parmenide. Due saggi per una nuova lettura del poema*, Roma, Edizioni dell\'Ateneo, 1975) have argued, for instance, that his poem should not be read as an ontological discourse of true reality, but as a speech that, in allegorical terms, invites the citizens of Elea to abandon the civil strife and to find political peace/unity. In other words, the One of Parmenides is read as an allegory of the union of the many civic factions in rivalry into the single body of the city. Although Capizzi\'s thesis has been criticized for having neglected the evident metaphysical/epistemological dimension of the Parmenidean poem, his study positively shows that this work cannot be reduced just to a discourse on Being.

My paper will try to investigate the potential link between Parmenides and eudaimonism. The Parmenidean poem could also be read as a discourse on happiness. Or at least, I would argue that it was read in these terms by philosophers who gave a eudemonistic direction to their activity. To be more precise, I would defend two points.

On the one hand, I suggest that in some metaphysical fragments of Parmenides\' poem one could also find an ethical meaning. In particular, through a look at fr. 28 B 6 DK, namely of the description of the ordinary human beings who are two-headed (*dikranoi*) and gripped by helplessness or hardship (*amechania*), I would defend the hypothesis that the contemplation of true Being will extinguish this condition of distress. The study of reality is productive not only for theoretical knowledge, but also for tranquility, *i.e.* for personal happiness.

On the other hand, I would indicate two possible case-studies of reception of the Parmenidean idea that Being is without change and identical in itself (cf. the central verses of fr. 28 B 8 DK). These are Democritus and the Socratic Megarians. The former could echo the changelessness/identity of the Parmenidean Being and apply it for describing happiness in fr. 68 B 69 DK. Indeed, Democritus says here that the good and the truth are identical to all human beings. Here, he might refer to *euthymia*, that in fr. 68 B 191 DK is described as the equilibrium and the immunity to violent/powerful changes, hence to a sort of Parmenidean stability. The Megarians studied instead Parmenides\' metaphysics and, apparently, used it in their description of the good as unique, identical and equal to itself, although it is called with different names (*e.g.* wisdom, god, mind). Moreover, the Megarian Euclides affirmed, by starting from this perspective, that evil does not exist and is without reality. *Mutatis mutandis*, this conception is a moral translation to the ethical sphere of Parmenides\' rejection of change in Being.
