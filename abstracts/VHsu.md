How should we visualize the space of Parmenides’ proem? The narrator’s chariot ride along the sun’s path has been interpreted as either an ascent or descent: on the one hand, the narrator and the Heliades appear to ascend towards the light to a set of aetherial gates. On the other hand, these gates of the paths of Night and Day, which open to form a χάσμ’ ἀχανές, clearly allude to Hesiod’s underworld χάσμα μέγ᾽of Tartarus and the threshold of Night and Day (Th. 736-50). In this paper, I propose that Parmenides’ striking figura etymologica of χάσμ’ ἀχανές participates in a Greek tendency to project the underworld into the heavens. First, I survey the historical linguistic evidence and propose that Parmenides coined the adjective ἀχανές, first attested in his poem. I refute the recent proposal of van Beek that the alpha-prefix of ἀχανές emerges from a local particle *ad and follow Mitchell Miller’s argument (2006) that the alpha prefix in ἀχανές was understood as both intensive and privative. However, following Robert Mondi’s proposed etymology of Hesiod’s χάσμα and χάος, I reject Miller’s conflation of the χάσμα and χάος (Miller 2001). This conflation limits the function of ἀχανές, which I interpret as oscillating between its privative and intensive meanings to indicate a χάσμα closing and opening infinitely outward to recall the boundless χάος. Jaap Mansfeld has argued that Parmenides took the Hesiodic χάσμα located at the edge of the cosmos and, on account of his notion of a spherical earth, placed it in the sky. I follow Mansfeld’s reading and go further: Parmenides participated in and influenced a tradition to project the underworld into the heavens. This tradition can be seen, for instance, in Heraclides Ponticus’s notion of the Milky Way as a path of Hades (fr. 52 Schütrumpf) and in the Pythagorean view of the planets as “hounds of Persephone” (Porph.Vita Pythag. 41). In particular, Peter Kingsley has proposed that Philolaus’s central fire was borne out of two conflicting cosmic paradigms: first, the Homeric location of Tartarus far beneath the earth (Il. 8.13-16); and second, the Pythagorean identification of Tartarus and Hades with the volcanic fires of Sicily inside the earth. Philolaus had therefore displaced the earth by projecting the fiery underworld Tartarus into the center of the cosmos. Key to Kingsley’s argument was that the Phaedo’s Pythagorean myth, which describes an underworld χάσμα vaster than all others and whose liquid “has no bottom or base” (πυθμένα οὐκ ἔχει οὐδὲ βάσιν, Phd. 112b), is influenced by an Orphic poem written by Zopyrus of Tarentum (OF 66b, οὐδέ τι πεῖραρ ὑπῆν οὐ πυθμήν οὐδέ τις ἕδρα). If this is the case, I argue that Parmenides’ boundless χάσμα may have participated in the same Orphic tradition; in its celestial projection, it may have influenced Philolaus.
