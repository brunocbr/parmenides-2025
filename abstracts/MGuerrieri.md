title: Parmenides as a Poet
---
In recent years, significant progress has been made in interpreting Parmenides’ philosophy. If Casertano (1978) had already surpassed the old interpretation of Parmenides as a denier of movement and existence of worldly things, but also portrayed the Eleatic as a “mere” scientist, further research continued to shed light on the Venerable philosopher – from N.-L. Cordero to B. Conte, from J. Palmer to S. Tor. Parmenides clearly turns out to have never denied the world: thus, this paper embraces this recent view to propose an explanation of the most-debated problem of the Eleatic’s thought, i.e. the relationship between Truth and Opinion, and between What-is and Phenomena. In order to do so, and to try to solve some crucial aporias in this difficult matter, this paper will adopt the fundamental – yet often overlooked – approach of considering Parmenides for who he was: a poet. In a world where Plato had not yet renewed the meaning of the word φιλοσοφία, and thoughts were still rarely expressed in prose, it is crucial to analyse how the Eleatic actually conceived his work of art. In particular, the main topic of the paper will be the analysis of three specific figures of speech as used by Parmenides: comparison, synecdoche, and hysteron proteron. Reflecting on the almost never considered use of these three poetic strategies could offer a chance of proposing a precise interpretation of the whole of Parmenides’ poem, and of solving some problems that always challenged the scholarship. In conclusion, by unveiling the poetic structure of his work and considering contemporary research findings, it could be possible to provide a fresh perspective on Parmenides’ philosophical vision.
