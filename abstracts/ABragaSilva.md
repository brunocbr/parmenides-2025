title: "Speaking correctly of the reality: Parmenides’ PNC and Plato’s reception\
  \ thereof"
---
Plato’s stance regarding Parmenides’ philosophy has long been the subject of extensive debate in scholarly literature, and the issue if the Athenian did or not justice to the early philosopher is never old-fashioned (Cordero, 1979, 2007; O’Brien, 1987; Frère, 1991; Scolnicov, 1995; Palmer, 1999; etc.). Concerning the rules to speak of the reality, especially the Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC), it could not be different.

Although it is recognized by several scholars that in Plato's Republic (IV, 436b8-9; 436e8-437a2) and Sophist (230b4-d4) are found the first explicit formulations of the PNC prior to Aristotle’s, the point is much disputed (see Adam 1902, Robinson 1971, Woods 1987, Annas 1991, Thom 1999, Bobonich 2002, Lorenz 2004, Ferrari 2007, Delcomminette 2008). Now it is really noteworthy that, in both dialogues, the contexts of Platonic treatment of PNC is the discussion of possible consequences of Parmenides' Poem, in which Plato seems to have see some original version of PNC: it is not possible not-being to be (DK28 B7; see Scolnicov, 1995; Palmer, 1999). One can say that, in Plato’s eyes, Parmenidean version is a “strong” or “absolute” version of PNC, considering that the disjunction has been drawn as exhaustive: either it is, and cannot not be, or it is not, and cannot be – and tertium non datur (see also DK28 B2 and B8).

Indeed, that version of PNC would bring many problems for Platonic philosphy, as we shall see. In the Republic, in order to avoid some of these problems, Plato chose, so to speak, to 'weaken' the Parmenidean PNC by adding quantifiers that undermine its 'absoluteness': it is not possible “for the same being at the same time in the same respect and the same relation to suffer, do or be contraries” (Republic, IV 436e8-437). Notwithstanding, the difficulties of the Eleatic absolute PNC will return in corpus platonicum in a deeper way: the Sophist shows that a radical interpretation of Parmenidean PNC precludes any predication. This should, therefore, entail serious aporias to the Platonic philosophy of language (the impossibility of false statements), epistemology (the impossibility of false belief), ontology (the impossibility of plurality), and others. In the Sophist, as Parmenides is in the foreground of the debate, Plato's strategy is notably different from what was presented in the Republic. However, one can still ask: after all, did Plato do justice to Parmenides? (Stokes 1971, Furley 1973, Vitali 1977, Cordero 1979 & 2007, Nehamas 1981, O’Brien 1987, Scolnicov 1995 & 2003, Parmer 1999, Pulpito 2005, Mourelatos 2008, Hermann 2011, Galgano 2017). This paper will face the following issues:


i) Would Parmenides have really presented the ‘stronger’ version of PNC?
ii) Is the Platonic version of PNC compatible with the Parmenidean one?
iii) Why did the supposed Platonic 'attenuation' of the Eleatic PNC follow different paths in the Republic and in the Sophist?
iv) When dwelling on the PNC, did Plato do justice to Parmenides?
