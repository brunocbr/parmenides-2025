title: The Parmenidean denial of the principles of “identity” and “excluded middle” (B8:53-59)
---

There has long been disagreement between those who see structures of thought in the fragments of Parmenides' poem that unequivocally prelude to the logical forms to which universally known names were later assigned, and who believe Parmenides played an important role in the "prehistory" of logic, and those who conclude there is no embryo of this nature.

We can agree that there are many types of logic, such as extensional, predicational, bivalent, intuitionistic, polyvalent, modal, operational, and complex, among others. We can also agree that Parmenides' doctrine conveys its own logic based on the fact that it is a doctrine of truth and therefore can be understood as a logic.

However, if we look for the three axioms of classical propositional logic --- the law of identity (LOI), the law of non-contradiction (LNC) and the law of the excluded middle (LEM) --- in his poem, we will not only fail to find these logical principles, but also discover that Parmenides demolishes any form of reasoning based on them. He strictly excludes them from the only possible way of thinking (*hodós noesai*, to paraphrase Parmenides B2) and therefore from understanding the truth of "being".

Parmenides' statements are interconnected, and he engages in a discourse on the implications and contradictions in a manner that can be characterized as logical from a linguistic perspective. Indeed, it cannot be denied that he utilizes logical forms that would subsequently be designated with universally recognized nomenclature. This phenomenon, however, does not stem from the fact that his logic inherently contained the "seeds" of these forms, so to speak. Rather, it is a consequence of the fact that he thinks, speaks, and writes in a language whose grammar "works" according to those principles and also lends itself to their thematic elaboration: the Greek language (Benveniste).

Cordero's assertion that Plato and Aristotle's "Copernican revolution" in terms of Parmenides' conception of truth constitutes, in essence, a reversion to a bygone era, specifically the predicate conception of truth that was already in circulation during Homeric times, is indeed accurate. Nevertheless, this observation does not diminish the significance of Heidegger's discourse on the "ontological" concept of truth as articulated by Parmenides.

While concurring with Cordero's assertion that it is inaccurate to characterize it as "antepredicative truth" -- or, more precisely, "experience," to employ the term used by the German philosopher -- it is equally challenging to subscribe to his conclusion that "'ontological truth' existed, but it had a very short life", at least from a philosophical standpoint. Parmenides' ideas are cast in a language very different from even non-Classical logic. Borrowing a locution from the world of the New York theater, where plays can be presented "off-off-Broadway", we could say that the logic Parmenides uses is 'non-non-Classical'. Indeed, I believe it was necessary to wait for the insights of Hegel's dialectic and Einstein's cosmology before we could begin to understand Parmenides' doctrine of "being".

Cordero himself has noted that Parmenides posits "being" as a condition, not as a consequence, of thinking (and speaking), and not vice versa. Moreover, the scholar recognizes that Parmenides' reflection commences with the interrogation of human thought and language concerning the world, a notion that scholars such as Bernabé, Bollack, and Couloubaritsis, among others, have previously explored in varied respects, and it entails the re-functionalization of grammatical and narrative tools that, according to his analysis, were deemed inadequate by his contemporaries in comprehending reality in its veracity. This re-functionalization is initiated through a rethinking of the use of the verb "to be". Parmenides thus develops a theological and cosmological language that allows us to think and speak "truthfully" about reality, or "being," which, although 'before' all language (in the Heideggerian sense), is thinkable and sayable precisely because it posits the possibility of all saying and thinking.

In this paper, we will examine the *pars destruens* of this question. In the initial section, it will be demonstrated that the arguments employed by Parmenides in the so-called first part of his poem to substantiate the absoluteness of "being" with respect to "non-being" are not logical but rather cosmological in nature.

Indeed, the law of non-contradiction is predicated on the recognition of both possibilities of contradictory terms as valid. When classical logic is called upon to judge whether "being" \'is\' or \'is not\', it can only conclude that both possibilities cannot be true or false simultaneously. The law does not exclude "non-being" or the idea that "being" cannot be. Consequently, it posits, at least in principle, the possibility of the existence of "non-being."

Nevertheless, Parmenides is unequivocal regarding this issue: «... you could not know that which is not (for this is impracticable) \| nor could you show it» (B2:7-8). Though both the technique of double negation and that of *reductio ad absurdum* can be seen in his reasoning, he never presents an alternative between "being" and "non-being" because the latter is simply unthinkable. This is why the "way of thinking" that admits the possibility of "non-being" is excluded *a priori* because it informs the doctrines (*gnomai*; B8:61) of "two-headed" humans who know nothing (B6). This «way» is, in fact, founded upon a dualistic logic, which employs the laws of identity and excluded middle (which in turn descend from the principle of non-contradiction). In the second part of the presentation, it will be proposed that Parmenides clearly identifies these laws, to stigmatize them, in verses B8, 53--59.
