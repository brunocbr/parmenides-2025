title: Female Figures on the Path of Parmenides
---
In the Prologue of Parmenides' Poem, there is a notable, perhaps exclusive, presence of female guides and companions: mares (*híppoi*) and maidens (*koûrai*), but especially the "daughters of the Sun" and two specific goddesses, one named, the other not. I will argue that the female presence is directly dependent on the Orphic setting of these initial verses of the Poem and the journey described therein.
