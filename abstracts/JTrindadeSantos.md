We intend to interpret Truth without neglecting *Doxa*.

1. Truth  
B2.  
About any topic of enquiry one can “only think”\: “\(*it*\) is”, “\(*it*\) is not” \(3a, 5a\). The negative makes these ‘opposite’; the following modal clauses \(3b, 5b\) turn them into ‘mutually exclusive opposites’ \(2-5\). “Is not” is “totally uninformative” \(6\) and “unrecognisable” by thought \(7\) since ‘*this*’ \(*to\:* which we presuppose “\(*it*\) is”\) “is not” \(*mê eon*\). Lacking ‘identity’, “the not-true route” is abandoned \(B8.17-18\), leaving “is”, recognised by ‘thought’, to support the identity of ‘what is’.   
B6.\(1-2a\)   
‘“Saying’ and ‘thinking’ that ‘what is’ “is” \(B6.1\) — for it “can be” \(while\) “nothing is not” \(1b-2a\) —, recognises ‘what is’ as the numerically one entity whose ‘qualitative identity’ formally covers any potential intentional object of research. B8.   
To confirm ‘what is’ as support for ‘qualitative identity’, it is identified it with four negated attributes\: “ungenerable and indestructible”, “indivisible”, “immovable”, “non-incomplete and complete”. As each one of the attributes negates some operative concept used by cosmological theories, the identification of ‘what is’ with their antitheses proves its rejection of ‘what is not’.   
Coextensive with ‘thinking’, *tôi* \(38b\) points to ‘what is’ as the real referent of all ‘*names*’ mortals established \(38b\) thus granting maximal extension to its ‘qualitative identity’, and acknowledging the contents of *doxa.*

2. *Doxa*  
This program of research supports a conception of ‘identity’ which meets the requirements imposed by B8, but not those current on the “plausible world-order” of mortals \(53-59\: 38b-41; B19\). Can “light” be the opposite of “night”, each one “separated from the other” — “the same with itself” and “not with the other” \(52b-53a\) —, if “together both of them are” \(B9.3-4\)? Why have mortals “gone astray” when they named *two* opposites \(54\) “the same and not the same” \(57b-58a\)?
In the “world-order” of mortals \(B8.59\), “the nature of sense-organs thinks” \(B16.3\) opposites \(B10, B12, B14, B15, B18\) as “what exceeds” \(B16.4b\) in the κρᾶσις \(B16.1\). However, if we choose “the full” \(4b\) as subject of “what thinks” \(3a\), acting through the “powers” \(B9.2\) of enantiomorphs — “both equally coexisting together” \(B9.3-4; B16.2b-4\) —, \[opposites\] are names men established for each thing \(B19.1b-3\) persuaded that they were true \(B8.39-41\).

3. Conclusion  
*On nature* aims to instruct mankind. While Jonian “*physikoi*” are part of the refutation \(B8\), “mortals” \(B8.52-59\) and “men”, only slightly mentioned, eventually stand corrected. Assuring the continuity of Eleatic metaphysics, as a transcendental argument on the *a priori* conditions of possibility of enquiry, Truth establishes some formal requirements an ‘intentional object’ of research must satisfy. Excluding theories which reduce ‘Life’ to a chain of physical processes, “is” aims at its intentional object of research supporting the identity of ‘what is’ by the ‘cohesive unity’ of its conceptual network. Ruled by complementary operators, *doxai* and Truth will learn to coexist in philosophy, through the unstable balance between varying cognitive capabilities. Though incompatible with one another ‘mixture’/‘opposition’ and ‘identity’/‘negation’ are not exclusive ‘opposites’.
