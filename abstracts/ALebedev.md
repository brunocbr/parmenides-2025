title: Textual and hermeneutic notes on Parmenides' Proem

1.2-3 ὁδὸν... δαίμονος ... ἣ κατὰ πάντα \<πο\>τῆι φέρει εἰδότα φῶτα. "the road of the goddess that carries the man of knowledge by flight across the Universe." Ποτή is a Homeric word attested in *Odyssey* 5.337: Leucothea, feeling compassion for Odysseus᾽ troubles, transformed herself into a diving-bird and «ascended from sea by flight» (ποτῆι ἀνεδύσατο λίμνης), then sat on the raft. Lexicographers gloss the word as πτῆσις, sometimes as ὁρμή. In Aratus the constellation of Cygnus «flies like bird» (ποτὴν ὄρνιθι ἐοικὼς ... φέρεται), ποτή again is combined with the same verb as in Parmenides (φέρεσθαι). Since the word ποτή is regularly associated with the flight of birds and wings (in Hymn. Mercur. 544 ποτῆισι is v. l. for πτερύγεσσι), the chariot of Kouros should be envisaged as a winged chariot, and so the similarity with Plato's comparison of the soul with ὑπόπτερον ζεῦγος καὶ ἡνίοχος in Phaedrus 246 a 3--b 4 becomes striking. The connection was recognized already by Hermias, In Platonis Phaedrum 122, 19 ff., and by some modern scholars, Hermann Diels and Paul Natorp among others .

The restoration of the original text of v.1.3 provides additional important evidence on the 'trip' of Kouros conceived as a flight. It is a flight 'across the Universe' towards the sky, and not a *katabasis* (contra Burkert, Mansfeld and others), its goal being the 'celestial gates' where αἰθέριαι refers to their location 'high in the sky', not to their material. The genuine mythopoetic source of Parmenides' image is not the passage from Hesiod' *Theogony* 744 ff., but the Homeric passage *Il*.5, 748 ff. on the gates to Olympus guarded by *Horai*, one of which is *Dike*.

1.29 ἠμὲν Ἀληθείης εὐπειθέος ἀτρεκὲς ἦτόρ. The MSS. variants fall into two groups εὐκυκλέος ἀτρεμές (ontological reading) and εὐπειθέος ἀτρεκές (epistemological). Ionian ἀτρεκές (unknown in Attic prose) is undoubtedly *lectio difficilior*. Once it had been corrupted to trivial ἀτρεμές (still extant on Modern Greek ἄτρεμος), the Neoplatonists invented the erratic from εὐκυκλής. They invented this because 'unmoved' objects cannot speak or to be 'persuasive', but they can be 'well-rounded' or 'shining'. Εὐπειθής is predominantly used of persons, this means that Ἀληθείη is personified, i.e. conceived as a goddess (δαίμων). And this, in turn, reveals the name of the Goddess of Revelation, the celestial Pythia l.22 that welcomes Kouros behind the threshold of Olympic Temple. The chances are that she is the same as the 'goddess of the road' in verse 3: the road of Aletheia is the way of philosophy, εἰδὼς ἀνήρ is just a poetic phrase for 'philosopher.' Ἦτορ is used exclusively of the heart of living beings, including the heart of gods like Zeus; It is full of thoughts, feelings etc., but it never refers to inanimate 'unmoved' objects: "unmoved" heart is a dead heart! The goddess Aletheia reveals to Kouros *her own* heart that contains all secrets of the divine wisdom. She reveals to him the "infallible heart of the persuasive Truth".

1.32 ὡς τὰ δοκοῦντα / χρῆν δοκίμως εἷναι διὰ παντὸς πάντα περῶντα. Scholars who try to make sense of the ungrammatical and absurd text printed in *DK*, are wasting their efforts. The combination τὰ δοκοῦντα ... εἶναι is indefensible because it contradicts everything the Goddess of Revelation tells Kouros in the following lines. In 2017 I proposed to read δοκίμως ἱέναι "to utter" or "to recite in verse." *LSJ*, q.v. I, 2, especially ἱέναι ἔπεα *Il*. 3.221. The words μάνθανε κόσμον ἐμῶν ἐπέων ἀπατηλόν 8.52 echo the end of the proem μαθήσεαι ὡς τὰ δοκοῦντα .. εἷναι, it is a fulfillment of initial promise. Now it occurs to me that the same sense can be obtained even without transposing two letters: we can retain ΕΙΝΑΙ as tradition, but to interpret it as εἷναι, not as εἶναι. It is a rare fοrm of the same verb ἱέναι. Thus, δοκοῦντα becomes a direct object of εἷναι, and περῶντα becomes *acc.sing.* construed with σε in 1.28: "but nevertheless you will learn this also: how to recount in a plausible way things that only seem to be while going through \[i.e., discussing in detail'\] all things to the last one", i.e., expounding cosmology.
