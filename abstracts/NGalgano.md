title: Parmenides DK 28 B 4, the discovery of the abstraction
---

I want to propose an interpretation of DK 28 B 4 from a psychological point of view, which, as far as I know, was never attempted. In this fragment, the first verse is a precept about something that happens in the mind, where things are present although absent. The other verses consist of two arguments in support of the precept: 1) eon does not admit internal fractures in which non-being can be installed; 2) eon does not allow a variation of concentration in itself. Parmenides sheds light on a process of our cognition. When we think of anything, we think of it as a separated object from other beings around it. For example, if one thinks of a pen on a table, he thinks that it is something loose, separated from the table. This perception is reinforced by actions such as that of taking away the pen from the table. Then, the conclusion would be that the pen is an object isolated from the other objects and ultimately from the remainder being. Parmenides realizes that the real pen is not something loose, because if that were so, there would be non-being around it, which is impossible. Notwithstanding, we only thinks of the pen as separated from all entities to which it adheres; therefore, they are absent in our mind. We call this mental process ‘abstraction’ (ab + traho), because we focus our attention on a part of our perception, leaving the remainder being in a cognitive shadow, as if we would take that object out from the rest of the reality. The fragment 4 describes this process as an error of human perception, so we need to tailor our thoughts to the laws of eon and make the necessary cognitive corrections in order to follow the path of the persuasion, which goes with the truth. If this is right, in fragment 4 Parmenides provides the first description, in the history, of the mental process called abstraction.
