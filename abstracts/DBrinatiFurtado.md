title: "Parmenides’ goddess and Gorgias’ Helen: the problem of truth and persuasion"
---
In my presentation I will propose a reading of Gorgias' *Encomium of Helen* as a response to a notion of *alêtheia* that is present in Parmenides' poem. I will argue that Gorgias challenges Parmenides' association of a *pistos logos* with *alêtheia* and *peithô* by showing how persuasive *logos* can be related to *apathê* and *doxa*. In order to sustain my argument, I will first do parallels between the *Encomium* and some fragments of the poem and show how Gorgias resumes some points raised by Parmenides that concern the relation between *alêtheia* and *peithô* on one side, and the relation between *apatê*, *doxa* and *kosmos* on the other. Then, I will focus on their differences in view of demonstrating how Gorgias plays with these notions while criticizing demonstrations -- as Parmenides' -- that rely on a direct relation between *alêtheia* and *peithô*.

Gorgias begins his *Encomium* (§1) by stating that the *kosmos* of the *logos* is *alêtheia*. Here we already observe a different use of these words from the one we see in Parmenides' poem. In the poem (DK 8 50-53), the goddess says that she presented a *pistos logos* with the thought of *alêtheia*. She contrasts her position with the opinions of the mortals that concern a deceiving (*apatê*) *kosmos* of her words. Of course, since Gorgias probably did not have plain access to Parmenides' poem, it is unlikely that it is the case of such a precise reference to the wording of the poem. However, I will use this similarity (along with others that I do not have space here to point to) as a sign that there are at least echoes of Parmenides' concept in Gorgias' *Encomium*.

I will argue that Gorgias' point is that, although there is a *kosmos* of *logos* that is related to *alêtheia*, it is not necessary that this *alêtheia* is related to *peithô*. He does so by presenting the *Encomium* as a demonstration that shows the truth (§2) of Helen not being the cause for the war, however, when he starts exploring the human aspects that would make her vulnerable to greater forces (which would be the possible causes for the war instead of her), he shows that truth is not necessary for a speech to be persuasive.

I am not trying to say that the *Encomium* does not aim at a true demonstration, or that it is not persuasive, instead, what I will show is that Gorgias plays with what is expected of a true and persuasive demonstration. The *Encomium*, like the goddess, aims at truth, however, the *Encomium* shows the truth about Helen's case by demonstrating how humans usually rely on opinion and can be persuaded by a speech that deceives.
