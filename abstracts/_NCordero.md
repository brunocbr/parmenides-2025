title: The unfortunate lacuna in Parmenides' verse 6.3 DK
---
The text we call “Parmenides' Poem” is in fact a collection of nineteen quotations (one hundred and sixty verses) recovered from a lost original. Each word is of vital importance, as is the absence of a word in the case of a lacuna. This work deals precisely with a lacuna in the last hexameter of verse 3 of fragment 6, which can be found in all manuscripts of its source, Simplicius' Commentary on Aristotle's Physics. In order to make the text legible, the first editor of this work (1526) added a clumsy expression, as it did not coincide with the context. Since then, however, the conjecture has been unanimously accepted and, with a slight modification, was enshrined in the edition (first of Simplicius and then of Parmenides) by the eminent philologist Hermann Diels. We attempt to demonstrate the harmful effects that the conjecture has had for Parmenidean studies, and propose a less dangerous hypothesis.
