title: Parmenides’ *hodos*, the early Greek concept of *physis*, and the importance of models
---
As I have argued (Folit-Weinberg 2022, Folit-Weinberg 2023), Parmenides’ use of the model of the hodos plays a decisive role in his apparent invention of i) extended deductive argumentation, ii) an epistemology predicated on the power of such argumentation, and iii) the notion of being. In this paper, I revisit these claims in light of developments in the study of analogy, especially Mary Morgan’s notion of the “world in the model,” and analogically-oriented arguments (advanced by e.g. Arnaud Macé) about the emergence of the concept of physis in early Greek thought. I conclude by considering the power of the specific words and models to shape discursive, epistemological, and ontological frameworks.
